# List each of your own teams (by number), one per line.
# The team on the first line will determine the Location/State of competion
# (i.e., for rankings). The scoreboard will monitor these teams standings,
# both overall, within the State, and in relation to the ones listed in the
# 'lookups' file. Ensure you associate these teams with a name in the 'lookups'
# file so that they get monitored correctly.
